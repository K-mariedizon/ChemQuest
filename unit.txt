  Units of Measure
  Systeme Internationale (SI)
	- Consists of seven independent base units, and each unit is represented by a symbol
	- Used because compounds react on a molar basis, and expression of amounts of substances in such terms allows for a better understanding of the relative proportion of compounds

  7 Base SI units:
	a. Meter (m)- length
	b. Kilogram (kg)- mass
	c. Second (s)- time
	d. Mole (mol)- quantity of substance
	e. Ampere (A)- electric current
	f. Kelvin (K)- thermodynamic temperature
	g. Candela (cd)- luminous intensity

  Notes:
	- It has been recommended that analytes be reported using moles of solute/ volume of solution (mmol/L)
	- Enzyme units are given as the International Unit per liter (U/L) although katal unit has been adopted previously as the SI Unit, its use is limited
	- pH scale is retained for measurement of hydrogen ion concentrations
	- Liter is used as the reference volume
	- SI unit is used because compounds react on a molar basis, and expression of amounts of substances in such terms allows for a better understanding of the relative proportion of compounds


REAGENT PREPARATION AND LABORATORY SUPPLIES
	ANALYTIC CHEMICALS
	ANALYTIC REAGENT
	- Specifications established by the American Chemical Society
	- Labels on reagent state the actual impurities for each chemical lot OR list the maximum allowable impurities
	- Suitable for use in most analytic laboratory procedures

ULTRAPURE
	- Additional purification steps
	- For use in specific procedures such as chromatography, atomic absorption, immunoassays, molecular diagnostics, standardization or other techniques that require extremely pure chemicals

CHEMICALLY PURE OR PURE GRADE
	- Impurity limitations are not stated
	- Preparation of these chemicals is not uniform
	- Melting point analysis is often used to ascertain the acceptability purity range
	- Not recommended for use unless further purification or a reagent blank is included

UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA/ NATIONAL FORMULARY
	- Used to manufacture drugs
	- Limitations are based on the criterion of not being injurious to individuals
	- Purity standards are not based on laboratory needs

TECHNICAL/ COMMERCIAL GRADE
	- Used primarily in manufacturing and should never be used in the clinical laboratory


REFERENCE MATERIAL
	- primary Standard: highly purified chemical that can be measured directly to 
	- produce a substance of exact known concentration and purity
	- Secondary Standard: substance of lower purity with concentration determined by comparison with a primary standard

WATER SPECIFICATIONS
	- Tap water is unsuitable for lab procedures
	- Laboratories usually require REAGENT GRADE WATER

METHODS OF PURIFICATION
- DISTILLED WATER- purified only by distillation
- DEIONIZED WATER- purified by ion exchange
- RO WATER- reverse osmosis which pumps water across a semipermeable
